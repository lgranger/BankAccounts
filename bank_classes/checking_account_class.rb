# Create a `CheckingAccount` class which should inherit behavior from the `Account` class. It should include the following updated functionality:
# - Updated withdrawal functionality:
module Bank

require "./account_class.rb"

    class CheckingAccount < Account

      def initialize
        super
      end

      def withdraw(withdraw_amount, min_balance = -10_000)
        @balance = super
      end #of withdraw method

    end #of CheckingAccount class

end #end of medule
#   - Each withdrawal 'transaction' incurs a fee of $1 that is taken out of the balance. Returns the updated account balance.
#     - Does not allow the account to go negative. Will output a warning message and return the original un-modified balance.
# - `#withdraw_using_check(amount)`: The input amount gets taken out of the account as a result of a check withdrawal. Returns the updated account balance.
#   - Allows the account to go into overdraft up to -$10 but not any lower
#   - The user is allowed three free check uses in one month, but any subsequent use adds a $2 transaction fee
# # - `#reset_checks`: Resets the number of checks used to zero
